Food
===============================

I don't even know where to start here tbh. Hong Kong is a food haven, there are so many choices. Here's a couple of my
favourite ones, but honestly feel free to do some research on your own on where to go for these. Also I'm just listing
the classic HK stuff, I'm not even listing other cuisines because HK is basically known for having every cuisine in the
world in one city.

Just so you know, table-sharing is common in the local restaurants in HK (not in high-end places obviously) so don't be
surprised if they put you in a table with other people. HK is also not known for its hospitality, so waiters are
generally not very smiley and helpful like in the UK. But the good thing is there's absolutely no problem calling and
waving them over to the table (in fact if you don't they probably won't notice you), and there's absolutely no tipping
culture. But a 10% service charge or tea charge is common.

Most classic local places will probably speak Cantonese only with no English menu so you might wanna prepare Google
Translate, message me when you go, or maybe I can write down your order for you beforehand. A lot of these places are
cash only so make sure you prepare cash. Also at these places, the etiquette is to pay and leave as soon as you finish
eating because usually people will be queueing up outside and you're taking up space. But these are the most local and
authentic places you can go so I really recommend going. I'll mark these classic local places with [L]. You can usually
tell as well by the fact that the name ends with "Kee", a practice very common with old-school HK restaurants.

I've also marked [M] for restaurants that are recommended by Michelin.

Noodle Soup
-------------------------------

Noodle soups are probably what I miss the most from HK. There's just something about the noodles in HK that is so
nice and fulfilling. All of the noodle soup places in HK are very old-school. They are probably the most authentically
local food you could try.

### [Kau Kee 九記](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g294217-d795044.html) £ [L] [[M]](https://guide.michelin.com/gb/en/hong-kong-region/hong-kong/restaurant/kau-kee)

This is a **MUST VISIT**. It's in Central district so you'll be there anyways. Super well-known for its brisket noodle
soup and curry sauce. Got a Michelin star I think. There's different kinds of noodles you can choose from. My favourite
is the Curry Brisket and Beef Tendon Flat Noodle (咖喱牛筋腩伊麵). Don't go during typical lunch/dinner time unless you
want to queue for hours.

### [Wing Kee 榮記](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d8281481.html) £ [L]

This restaurant serves a style of noodle called [Cart Noodle (車仔麵)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cart_noodle),
called so because it used to be served roadside on mobile carts. Basically you pick a type of noodle, a type of broth,
and then you pick 5 toppings. Wing Kee is quite strict about the 5 toppings so don't ask for more. The toppings include
anything ranging from sausages, fishballs, wonton, to weirder stuff like pig skin, curdled pig's blood, beef offal etc.
Oh, and don't be surprised by the rude staff, they're kinda known for it.

### [Mak Man Kee 麥文記](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d800834.html) £ [L] [[M]](https://guide.michelin.com/gb/en/hong-kong-region/hong-kong/restaurant/mak-man-kee)

This restaurant is known for the best wonton noodles in HK. This one is recommended by my mum, I've never been there
(for some reason she was under the impression I didn't like wonton noodles so she never took me).

### [Kwan Kee 羣記](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d10813185.html) £ [L]

This one is known for its beef balls and pork knuckles. However, it's in Fanling which is way out in the middle of
nowhere. They also have brisket as well but personally I feel the brisket is not as good as Kau Kee. Best to order a
portion of beef balls and a portion of pork knuckles both to share, then each order a bowl of noodle soup.

Dim Sum 點心
-------------------------------

I know you can have it in London but in HK it's amazing. If you haven't had it before, it's basically small dishes of
lots of different food similar to tapas. People usually have dim sum as a breakfast/brunch thing.

### [Duen Kee 端記](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d9709398.html) £ [L]

For a truly local and authentic experience, come here. It's in a village called Chuen Lung village, surrounded by hills,
super old school. The dim sum are hand-made and cooked with water from the mountains. The dim sum are laid out in a main
area and you just grab the dishes you want. When you're done you talk to a waiter who will count the dishes and let you
know how much to pay. Problem with this place is that it's kinda in the middle of nowhere. It's reachable by bus but
it'll take a while to get there. You need to get there early in the morning if you want the most selections cuz if the
food runs out it runs out.

### [DimDimSum 點點心](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d2437900.html) ££

DimDimSum is a modern dim sum chain. Along with Tim Ho Wan below, the two chains are the most well-known dim sum chains
in HK. DimDimSum has a better atmosphere, the menu is also much closer to traditional dim sum dishes.

### [Tim Ho Wan 添好運](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d3749262.html) ££ [[M]](https://guide.michelin.com/gb/en/hong-kong-region/hong-kong/restaurant/tim-ho-wan-sham-shui-po)

Another modern dim sum chain. The quality of the food is maybe a smidge better than DimDimSum, but they do a more
modern take on some dim sum plates. They have some rather inventive new dishes as well which can be a hit or miss.

### [Sun Hing 新興食家](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d3163990.html) £ [L]

Very traditional old-school dim sum place. Again you have to grab the dim sum yourself, you don't get served. Super
crowded because it's a tiny place, and you'll definitely need to share a table. But there's not a more authentic
experience than this one. The quality of the dim sum is kinda mediocre, people go mainly for the experience.

Siu Mei 燒味
-------------------------------

[Siu Mei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siu_mei) are basically roast meats. You'll see these restaurants everywhere in
HK, they usually hang up roasted goose, chicken, pork etc behind a glass window. The most typical siu mei are char siu
(叉燒), roasted goose (燒鵝), roasted pork with crispy skin (燒肉), soy sauce chicken (油雞) and steamed chicken
(白切雞). To be honest, if you see a siu mei restaurant with good meats hanging behind the glass and lots of people
inside, chances are it's good so you don't need to seek them out. But there are still some restaurants well-known for
it.

### [Yue Kee 深井裕記燒鵝](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d784570.html) ££ [[M]](https://guide.michelin.com/gb/en/hong-kong-region/hong-kong/restaurant/yue-kee)

Basically when people in HK think of roasted goose, this place is the first place they think about. They also have lots
of other food but basically just go for the roasted goose. Problem with this restaurant is it's in a district that is
in the middle of nowhere and is not interesting at all. So it might not be worth it to go just to try the roasted goose.

### [Yung Kee Restaurant 鏞記酒家](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d785057.html) £££

Much more accessible than Yue Kee since it's in Central. I've actually never tried this one myself (I go to Yue Kee)
but this restaurant is well-known in HK for roasted goose as well. Just be aware that this restaurant is quite pricey.

## Dai Pai Dong 大排檔

[Dai Pai Dong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_pai_dong) are basically food stalls, serving very local street food.
They're usually half-outdoors just next to the street. Unfortunately the old-school ones have mostly disappeared since
the government doesn't issue those licenses anymore. There's a few I used to go as a kid that have all closed down.

### [Sing Kee 盛記](https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/r-sing-kee-central-hong-kong-style-r10580) £ [L]

One of very few old-school dai pai dongs left in HK. All seatings are outdoors next to the road... it doesn't get much
more local than that. It's not a proper restaurant so I can't even find the link on trip advisor. Go there early because
the queues are super long, and try to avoid usual lunch or dinner times.

### [Chorland 楚撚記](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d14115803.html) ££

This is actually a chain, there's a few of them across HK. The one I linked is close to where I live so that's just the
one I go to. It's basically a modern take on dai pai dong, they're indoor restaurants but decorated to look like dai pai
dong. They serve traditional dai pai dong food, and while it doesn't feel quite the same, I'd say they capture the
atmosphere pretty well. Two things I highly recommend trying are roasted pigeon (燒乳鴿) and pig's blood (豬紅).

Cha Chaan Teng 茶餐廳/冰室
-------------------------------

[Cha Chaan Teng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha_chaan_teng) are basically HK-style cafes that are a weird mix of
Western and Chinese style food and drinks. They usually don't offer proper meals, they're best to go for breakfast or an
afternoon tea. I don't have any specific recommendations for Cha Chaan Teng, but if you come across one then you should
definitely try the following things:

- [Pineapple Bun (菠蘿包)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple_bun)
    - No it doesn't have pineapple in it. It looks like a pineapple. It's basically a giant sweet crispy bun. It's
      listed
      as a HK cultural heritage.
- [Egg Tarts (蛋撻)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_tart)
    - It's kind of like pastel de nata and custard tart. Also a HK cultural heritage. Try the ones with puff pastry.
- Hong Kong Style Milk Tea (奶茶)
    - Best version of this is called caa zau (茶走), which uses condensed milk to make it. The condensed milk is very
      sweet so don't add sugar. It's an insanely evil but insanely good drink.
- Yuenyeung (鴛鴦)
    - It's coffee mixed with milk tea. Sounds weird but trust me it's really nice.

Others
-------------------------------

### [Chi Lin Vegetarian 志蓮素齋](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d2481861.html) ££

It's located in Nan Lian Garden which is a place that will be in my
[recommend visiting](Places.md#nan-lian-garden--chi-lin-nunnery) list. It's run by a Buddhist nunnery so it's completely
vegetarian. The food is insanely good here, I've always said I can become a vegetarian if I can visit this restaurant
every day. It's a slightly more expensive compared to the rest of the list but by London standards it's practically
nothing. If you're going with a friend I'd recommend getting Set A for two people. The set is about £45 (total, not per
person) and you get to try 7 different dishes. It's a popular restaurant so try to make a booking if you can.

### [Chuen Kee 全記](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d1207221.html) £££ [[M]](https://guide.michelin.com/gb/en/hong-kong-region/hong-kong/restaurant/chuen-kee-seafood)

This is the most expensive option in the entire list. It's a seafood restaurant. The reason I suggest this is because
it's in Sai Kung, which will be a place I recommend visiting anyways. The seafood are freshly caught in the morning, you
pick them out from the giant glass tanks in front of the restaurant. The seafood are extremely fresh and just super
delicious. It's cheap by London standards, but it's still seafood it's expensive. Make sure to ask the prices first,
don't order blindly. Note that there are two of them literally just across the street from each other. You want to go
to the one with outdoor seating and the glass tanks, not the one with the giant grand-looking entrance in a building.
I've set the location at the correct one on the Google Map.

### [Tono Daikiya 殿大喜屋](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/g294217-d11806937.html) ££

OK. It's the only non-HK cuisine I've put on this list. But honestly it's worth it. Unlimited sashimi / sushi / whatever
Japanese and Chinese dishes there are. It's a set price of around £35 per person, and you get these pieces of paper to
order as much food as you want. Seriously as much as you want. Just make a booking ahead of time since they're quite
popular.
