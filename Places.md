Places to Visit
===============================

HK is very special in that each tiny district / neighbourhood has an extremely distinct feel to them. Some districts
are so fully packed with unique attractions that it's worth staying in the area for a half-day or a full-day. For ease
of planning I've therefore split this page into sections based on the districts.

Central (with Sheung Wan / Admiralty)
-------------------------------

Central is the main business district of HK with lots of skyscrapers and giant malls. But it's built on a hill so the
whole district is on a super steep slope. As you climb higher it becomes less "metropolitan" and rapidly turns local,
with lots of dai pai dong street food, random market stalls and restaurants.

### Victoria Peak ★★★★★

The Peak is a **MUST** do. The view you get from the top of the mountain is breathtaking. You get to see the entire city
from the Hill. Typically people take **the Tram** up, it's a classic tourist experience. However, I personally find it
to be overrated since it's super crowded and you don't really see much of anything. Taking the bus up is actually
better. You also get to see the houses there, which are literally the most expensive houses in the entire world. When
you reach the peak, you can go up the tower to see the views, but it's expensive and it actually doesn't have the best
views. Go to [**Lugard Road**](https://patkay.com/blogs/pk/lugard-road-victoria-peak-best-view) instead, you get to see
the views much better unobstructed and it's a great photo spot. It's especially good during sunrise if you can wake up
and go early enough.

### Tai Kwun ★★★★★

Tai Kwun is a group of a bunch of buildings built in the late 1800s to early 1900s that are declared monuments. They
used to be a police station, courthouse and prison, but is now preserved and turned into a heritage and arts centre. If
you're interested in architecture it's definitely worth giving it a visit.

### Lan Kwai Fong ★★★★

Some of the best nightlife in the world. Lots of bars and clubs packed together in a street. Lots of music, dancing,
(drunk people...). Would recommend you at least pre-drink before you go, drinks are expensive. Please also watch your
valuables, there are a lot of thieves preying on drunk people.

### HSBC and Bank of China Towers ★★★★

Two most iconic skyscrapers in Hong Kong. Looks really cool and has a funny story. If you're not familiar with feng
shui, it's basically some Chinese superstition that believes the environment has energy that affects fortune. The HSBC
building was built incorporating a lot of feng shui into the architecture. When the Bank of China building was built
later it didn't respect feng shui at all, with its sharp edges considered as like "knives" facing and threatening the
HSBC building. The city also had an economic crisis at the time that the locals attributed to the building's feng shui.
In response to it, HSBC built two structures shaped like cannons at the top of the building facing the Bank of China
building so "counteract" against the negative energy.

### Man Mo Temple ★★★

A temple that has been declared a national monument, it's a Taoist temple dedicated to the literacy god and martial
arts god. It's one of Hong Kong's oldest temple so it's worth a visit, but in terms of scale it's nothing compared to
[Wong Tai Sin Temple](#wong-tai-sin-temple-).

### St John's Cathedral ★

Oldest cathedral in Hong Kong. Declared national monument. It's nice but it's really not very special. Nice to have a
look if you're near the area, but if you want to see a church, I'd highly recommend
[Holy Trinity Cathedral](#holy-trinity-cathedral-) instead.

### Mid-Levels Escalators ★

This is a super weird thing but given how the entire district is built on a hill, people got lazy climbing those steep
inclines every day. So they built a super super long set of outdoor escalators. Unfortunately it's also extremely
frustrating because the escalators are very slow.

Mong Kok
-------------------------------

Mong Kok is where I grew up so I have a huge fondness for it. It's where I spent most of my childhood and also where I
went to school. The name Mong Kok means "crowded district" and there's a reason. Mong Kok is literally the most densely
populated district in the world. While it is a shopping district, it is also where all the coolest markets and
restaurants are. There are some extremely interesting shopping arcades, each with a very specific theme. The ones I
recommend here are very specific and special ones that are not high street shopping at all. Trust me.

Mong Kok is also where you'll see the most neon light signs that is an icon of HK. Unfortunately tightened government
regulations in the last decade means that neon lights are rapidly disappearing from HK. Neon signs are a heritage that
HKers are very proud of and fighting to save (unfortunately in vain). See them when you still have the chance.

When you're walking around Mong Kok, please also keep an eye on street food. There are a LOT of street food stalls in
Mong Kok, and they are all amazing. Curry fishball is a Hong Kong classic, but my personal favourite is fried chicken
leg. Once you try fried chicken in HK you'll never be able to eat fried chicken in the UK again.

Bring cash when you're visiting Mong Kok. A lot of stalls and shops don't accept card. But watch your wallet, because
of how crowded it is, there are some pickpockets around.

### Ladies' Market ★★★★★

**Ladies Market** is an amazing flea / food market. The market is on Tung Choi Street, spanning across multiple city
blocks. Despite its name, it doesn't just sell ladies stuff. It has hundreds of stores selling anything from clothes
to weird gadgets and toys. Don't just focus on the stalls though, behind the stalls are lots of different restaurants
and [Cha Chaan Tengs](Food.md#cha-chaan-teng-茶餐廳冰室). It's usually open from noon, but best to visit in the late
afternoon / early evening since a lot of stalls open later.

Make sure you haggle, especially as a foreigner. The prices are marked up sometimes up to triple their intended price. I
go to this market a lot as a kid since it's close to my school, and most of the time I could haggle to like half of the
written price. Note that some of the stall owners can be very aggressive. If you looked at some things in the stall and
decide not to buy anything, they might even start chasing you down the street giving you cheaper prices and asking you
to reconsider. It is genuinely a solid haggling tactic to just start walking away, but if you really don't want to buy
just make sure to keep walking away and don't look back.

Nearby to Ladies' Market is also Sneaker Street. It's a street full of sneaker stores. Not worth spending a lot of time
there unless you're REALLY into sneakers, but it is weird to see a street literally just lined with sneakers.

### Golden Computer Arcade ★★★★★

This is not actually in Mong Kok, it's in Sham Shui Po which is another district. But it's very close to Mong Kok so
I've added it into this section.

Golden Computer Arcade is my heaven. Literally. If I die and go to heaven that's what it would look like. It's not
usually recommended in tourist guides because it's a local place, but oh man it's fantastic. It is literally a shopping
arcade for nerds. Computers, peripherals, cameras, gaming consoles, video games, tech gadgets... it's insane. It's a
little claustrophobic though since it's super packed with narrow corridors, but trust me it's worth a visit even if you
don't buy anything.

If you do plan to buy stuff, a lot of the prices already look cheap, but make sure you still haggle. Most shops mark up
their prices expecting people to haggle. If you're buying actual laptops or PCs, you can ask them to do some custom work
for you like upgrading / replacing some parts. Sometimes they'd even do it for free.

### Sino Centre ★★★★

Sino Centre is another nerd heaven and one of my personal favourites. I've spent so much time there with my friends when
I was at school. Crap I'm exposing how much of a nerd I am. Read this entry now, I might delete it soon.

Again it's not a typical tourist attraction, even a lot of HKers will not know about this place unless they spend a lot
of time in Mong Kok. It's a huge office building but the bottom few floors are shops. It is similar to Golden Computer
Arcade, but it's specifically only gaming, anime and collectibles. Literally an entire shopping arcade that's just full
of shops selling the nerdiest shit you can find anywhere.

I visited this place again when I went back to HK in March. I think my bank account was missing a few digits after.

### Temple Street Night Market ★★★★

Temple Street Night Market is a large flea market with lots of restaurants and stalls and it looks amazing with lots of
neon lights. I marked it as 5 stars originally, but downgraded it to 4 after reading that most stalls have closed and
it's no longer the same after the pandemic (I haven't gone since after the pandemic so I can't verify myself). If that's
true then it's a real shame.

Again, make sure to haggle if you're buying anything. Also please watch your pockets especially because you'll be
visiting at night.

### Bird Garden and Market ★★★

Birds. Birds everywhere. Just lots of different birds. The market is a street just entirely lined with food stalls. Next
to the market is a public garden that also showcases a lot of birds. It's a very small place though so it doesn't take
much time to see it.

Don't be alarmed by the birds in cages. It's the only way they're able to show and sell birds in the market, but talk to
the stall owners and you'll understand that most of them have an amazing love for birds and take great care of them.
There are also a lot of elderly retired guys there who literally does nothing but spend their entire day taking care of
these beautiful birds and are extremely knowledgeable in the welfare of the birds.

There is also a flower market right next to it. It's not worth a separate entry but it's also a sight to behold.

### Goldfish Market ★★

Yes. You guessed it. A street market for goldfish and other aquatic pets and plants. Similar to Bird Market, it is
quite amazing to see. Note though that for the goldfish market you need to go really early in the morning. The shops
and stalls close really early.

### Sincere Podium ★

Similar to Golden Computer Arcade and Sino Centre, but this time it's phones. Just phones. And phone accessories.
Nothing else. Second-hand phones, phone cases, phone chargers etc. The reason this is only one-star though is that
unless you have a huge enthusiasm for phones, it's not nearly as exciting as the other
two [Golden Computer Arcade](#golden-computer-arcade-) or [Sino Centre](#sino-centre-).

Wong Tai Sin / Diamond Hill
-------------------------------

These two districts are right next to each other so I've combined them into the same section.

### Nan Lian Garden ★★★★★

Nan Lian Garden is a gorgeous public garden maintained by the [Chi Lin Nunnery](#chi-lin-nunnery-). It is a very
traditional Chinese public garden, and every minute you spend in the garden is absolute zen and calm. The garden is
very large, and it is meticulously maintained. Not only that, the garden has a huge collection of extremely valuable
pine trees. This garden is not a very famous tourist attraction, but it's always one of my highest recommendations when
people ask me about HK.

Despite being a public garden, there are very strict rules while you're there. You're expected to be respectful
and keep the peaceful environment of the garden. Don't yell or run around. Taking pictures is fine, but don't do a huge
elaborate selfie setup or something. There are a lot of staff and they will ask you to leave if you cause any
disturbance.

The garden also has the best [vegetarian restaurant](Food.md#chi-lin-vegetarian-志蓮素齋-) I've ever gone to. It's the
only vegetarian restaurant I've ever genuinely liked.

### Wong Tai Sin Temple ★★★★★

Really large Taoist temple. It's very cool. Every year during Chinese New Year it attracts tens of thousands of citizens
going there to have their fortunes predicted. Traditionally even government officials go to the temple to "predict the
fortune of HK for the year". They do it by shaking a cup full of "fortune sticks" until one of the sticks falls out. The
stick will tell you your fortune. Yes, genuinely, tens of thousands of citizens do that every year.

Don't go if you're allergic to incense.

Watch your valuables and don't let people sell you overpriced tourist crap. They'll sell you incense at extortionate
prices telling you they grant wishes or something. Just be aware of that. Also in case you get confused, Wong Tai Sin
is also the name of the district.

### Chi Lin Nunnery ★★★★

Right next to Nan Lian Garden, it is a large traditional Buddhist temple. It's relatively new, but it's built following
strict Tang dynasty architecture and is very nice to see. Unlike Taoist temples like Wong Tai Sin temple which is always
busy, noisy and packed, Buddhist temples are just entirely zen.

### Holy Trinity Cathedral ★★★★

This one actually a bit of a distance away from the others and is not in the same district, but it's not in any of the
districts in the list so I've put it here. This is a very special Anglican cathedral that looks absolutely nothing like
a cathedral. In fact, it looks like a Chinese temple. It was built that way specifically so that it's easier for the
locals to accept it and consider converting to Anglicanism. This cathedral is not in any tourist guides but it's quite a
unique sight to see. Your brain will be confused seeing a cross on top of a Chinese temple.

Tsim Sha Tsui
-------------------------------

### Victoria Harbour (Avenue of Stars) ★★★★★

Victoria Harbour is where all the typical photos of Hong Kong are taken with all the skyscrapers. This is a **MUST**.
Don't see it from the HK side though, go to the Kowloon side because the skyscrapers are much prettier on the HK side.
The Avenue of Stars is a very nice walk around the harbour on the Kowloon side.

Victoria Harbour also has a show every night at 8pm. Go slightly early to get a nice spot (best spot is near the Hong
Kong Cultural Centre). All of the skyscrapers on the harbour coordinate together to do a massive light and laser show.
It's an absolute spectacle.

### Palace Museum ★★★★

I've actually never visited this myself yet. Opened only last year in 2022, it's a "gift" from China to show how
"generous" China is to HK. Blergh. But still, it's on my list to visit. It's essentially a museum with artifacts from
the Forbidden City in Beijing. Artifacts from the actual Palace Museum in Beijing are shipped and displayed in this
museum. And because China wanted to REALLY show their generosity, the pieces shown are the best pieces in Beijing's
museum.

Get tickets early though. They're gone extremely quickly.

### Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Pier ★★★★

The Star Ferry is another icon of Hong Kong. Cross the Victoria Harbour on the pier which will get you to Central. It's
extremely cheap and the views are amazing. It also has a pretty red brick clock tower that was almost torn down by the
government until it raised so much uproar from HKers that ended up saving it.

### Museum of History ★

Really nice museum that describes the (censored) history of HK. The museum is huge. It's also opposite to the Science
Museum which is actually quite cool as well. But this one is low on the list. Don't consider it unless you somehow
really have time to spare.

Sai Kung
-------------------------------

Sai Kung is a sea-side town with a very vibrant market and pier. It's an area that feels really different compared to
the rest of Hong Kong and it's well worth a visit. Unfortunately reaching Sai Kung is a bit of a pain since it's not
very well-connected in terms of public transport. The best way to get there is to take the 1A minibus from Choi Hung
MTR station (if you're lost, my parents literally live in the building above the station, ask them for help lol).

### Sai Kung Market / Seafood Street ★★★★★

Have a walk around the town where there are a LOT of restaurants. My friends and I used to just walk down the street,
going into a dozen restaurants just ordering one or two things from each one. It's an absolute blast. The restaurants
are also quite unique, I've found unique food there that I've never seen anywhere else in HK.

### Sai Kung Public Pier ★★★★★

If you go in the morning, you'll see lots of fishing boats parked around the pier selling fresh seafood to people. It's
really cool to see people looking over the pier as people in the fishing boats toss the seafood up to the customers.
There are also lots of boat rides you can take to a lot of tiny islands, where there are super interesting features.
There's a small island that just has a chapel on it. Some boat tours take you to some gorgeous beaches and mini hiking
trails. You can also kayak there if you want.

### Hong Kong Global Geopark ★★★★★

The Hong Kong Global Geopark is a UNESCO geological site and it looks awesome. The Geopark is technically across a huge
area across Eastern Hong Kong, but the most interesting features are around Sai Kung. You need to take a boat to get
there, make sure you go in the morning since the boats stop in the afternoon. The boats will take you to different
islands and caves all around Sai Kung where the hexagonal volcanic rock columns look really cool. Definitely worth
seeing.

Lantau Island
-------------------------------

### Tai O Fishing Village ★★★★★

Known as the Venice of Hong Kong, it is an entire village that's frozen for decades. The houses are built on stilts
in water, where locals get around with boats. Unlike a lot of so-called "fishing villages" in other countries that are
very commercialised for tourists, this village is extremely genuine in its traditional ways. You won't see any tourist
traps or price-gouging restaurants there, it's so hidden and surrounded by nature it feels like you've left HK for good.

There are also some boat tours that will take you out to the open sea where you might get the chance to see pink
dolphins. But you're not guaranteed to see them. In fact they're endangered and they're disappearing from HK, so go see
them when you still have the chance. They are actually completely entirely pink.

Yes the whole village smells of fish. It's a fishing village.

### Tian Tan Buddha and Po Lin Monastery ★★★★★

It's a giant bronze buddha. Looks really impressive. Underneath it is a Buddhist monastery. The statue is at the top of
a mountain, you can take the cable car (called Ngong Ping 360) to get there which is also a very nice experience. But
I'd actually recommend also hiking there. The hiking trail in that area is my favourite hiking trail in HK. It's not for
the faint of heart though. It's a genuinely difficult hiking trail that needs preparation for.

### Ocean Park ★★★

If you'd like to go to a theme park but you don't have enough time, go to Ocean Park instead of
[Disneyland](#disneyland-). One of the biggest theme parks in asia, it is an aquatic themed park (think Finding Dory)
that also happens to have a huge number of really hardcore roller-coaster rides. If I remember correctly it also has the
world's largest aquarium dome. It's actually not just marine animals though, they have other animals such as giant
pandas and red pandas.

Oh and if you're going during Halloween, bring a few pairs of spare trousers and pants. It hosts the largest Halloween
event in Asia. The haunted houses will scare the shit out of you literally. I think it actually killed someone a few
years ago.

### Disneyland ★★

It's cool that Hong Kong has Disneyland, and if you have extra time (and money, lots of money) then Disneyland is worth
a visit. HK's Disneyland is the smallest in the world, but on the other hand this means all the rides are much closer to
each other and you don't have to spend a huge amount of time walking from one attraction to the other.

Places to Avoid
-------------------------------

### Observation Wheel

HK's version of London Eye but it's surrounded by skyscrapers so you can't see shit.
