Places to Visit
===============================

HK is very special in that each tiny district / neighbourhood has an extremely distinct feel to them. Some districts
are so fully packed with unique attractions that it's worth staying in the area for a half-day or a full-day. For ease
of planning I've therefore grouped the most common attractions into districts first.

Central (with Sheung Wan / Admiralty)
-------------------------------

Google will do a much better job of describing the district but it's an insanely cool district. It's the main business
district with lots of skyscrapers and giant malls. But it's built on a hill so the whole district is on a super steep
slope. As you climb higher it becomes less "metropolitan" and rapidly turns local, with lots of dai pai dong street
food, random market stalls and restaurants.

### The Peak

The Peak is a **MUST**. The view you get from the top of the mountain is breathtaking. You get to see the entire city
from the Hill. Typically people take the Tram up, it's a classic tourist experience. However I personally find it to be
overrated since it's super crowded and you don't really see much of anything. Taking the bus up is actually better. You
also get to see the houses there, which are literally the most expensive houses in the entire world. When you reach the
peak, you can go up the tower to see the views, but it's expensive and it actually doesn't have the best views. Go to
[Lugard Road](https://patkay.com/blogs/pk/lugard-road-victoria-peak-best-view) instead, you get to see the views much
better unobstructed and it's a great photo spot. It's especially good during sunrise if you can wake up and go early
enough.

### Lan Kwai Fong

Some of the best nightlife in the world. Lots of bars and clubs packed together. Lots of drunk people, music, dancing.
Would recommend you at least pre-drink before you go. If you plan to get drunk there you'll be bankrupt quickly.

Mong Kok
-------------------------------

Mong Kok is an entire district but there are so many cool things to do there. It's also where I grew up so I have a
huge fondness for it. The main thing to visit there is **Temple Street Night Market**. It's a giant flea market with
lots of food shops behind the stalls and it looks super cool with lots of neon lights. Make sure to haggle if you're
buying anything. Also watch your pockets at the market. **Ladies Market** is another flea / food market there but that
one is mostly in the afternoon. **Sino Centre** is one of my favourite places in the world, it's a shopping centre
that's specifically gaming stuff, comics and collectibles. Also some street food stalls sell curry fishballs, please
try some they're heavenly. Or another one is **Sin Tat Plaza** which is a shopping centre specifically for phones.
There's also a specific **goldfish street** and **bird market** that's a sight to behold.

Sai Kung
-------------------------------

Sai Kung is a sea-side town. If you go in the morning, you'll see lots of fishing boats parked around the pier selling
fresh seafood to people. Have a walk around the town where there are a LOT of restaurants. My friends and I used to just
walk down the street, going into a dozen restaurants just ordering one or two things from each one. It's an absolute
blast. At the pier, there are lots of boat rides you can take to a lot of tiny islands, where there are super
interesting features. There's a small island that just has a chapel on it. Some boat tours take you to some gorgeous
beaches and mini hiking trails. You can also kayak there if you want. The most important boat tour to take is to the
hexagonal rock columns, it's a UNESCO geological site and it looks awesome. Make sure to go to Sai Kung early in the
morning, the boat rides stop in the afternoon.

Lantau Island
-------------------------------

### Ngong Ping (Big Buddha)

It's a giant bronze buddha. Looks really cool and impressive. It's at the top of a mountain, you can take the cable car
to get there which is also very nice. But I'd actually recommend also hiking there. The hiking trail in that area is
fantastic, you get to see the traditional farming villages and the nature is breathtaking. See the hiking section.

### Tai O Fishing Village

This is a lesser known spot in HK but it really should be

### Victoria Harbour (Avenue of Stars)

Victoria Harbour is where all the typical photos of Hong Kong are taken with all the skyscrapers. It's again a **MUST**.
Don't see it from the HK side though, go to the Kowloon side because the skyscrapers are much prettier on the HK side.
The Avenue of Stars is a very nice walk around the harbour on the Kowloon side.

Others
-------------------------------

### Wong Tai Sin Temple

Really large Taoist (not Buddhist) temple. It's super cool. But if you're going there, watch your valuables and don't
let people sell you overpriced tourist crap. They'll sell you incense at extortionate prices telling you they grant
wishes or something. Just be aware of that. Also in case you get confused, Wong Tai Sin is also the name of the
district so don't confuse it with the actual temple.

### Nan Lian Garden + Chi Lin Nunnery

### Golden Computer Arcade

Places to Avoid
